Overview
========

The **inforcehub** package contains various utilities and tools we find useful
in running data science tasks for customer management at insurers.

We all benefit from good open-source solutions. Therefore as a business we 
want to contribute some of our solutions back to the community for those that
may find them useful.  

Contributions are welcome - please see the :ref:`contributing section <contributing>` 
for more info.
